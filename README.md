----
## What does the app do?
This android application allows you to easily keep track remaining days until your big day, or even track days passed since your big day.

## What will the app do in the future?

If I ever get time I hope to be able to improve the layout alot, so that the countdown does not cover the majority of the screen. I want the user selected picture to be the center of attention.
Maybe I can make the countdown layout draggable (movable) so the user can place it wherever he likes and also make it smaller.

I also want to improve the performance of the app, as it currently handles the images a bit slow.
